Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
I have included three projects: The recipe card builder, the component library, and a search bar that looks through a library of quotes.

For the recipe card builder, the user enters the ingredients and the instructions, and can download a file that puts everything into a recipe card format.
This program is entire accessible by the keyboard and does not require the mouse. It also has aria tags for accessibility.

The component library program shows different type of web components, including navigation bars, animations, image carousels, etc.
The code is then available to copy and paste on the page so that others can use the components themselves.

The final project is a search bar with a quote underneath. By clicking anywhere on the page, it will choose a random quote from its library and display it on screen.
You can also use the search bar to search through both quotes and the people that said them. After you search, results will pull up on the screen and you may click on a quote to pin it, keeping it on screen while you search again.
